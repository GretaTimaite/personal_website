title: "AI/ML in the Social: Interdisciplinary Network Perspective"
abstract: The underlying premise of this presentation is that AI/ML systems represent and intervene in the social (Roberge and Castelle, 2021). I ask, thus, what emerges as the social in relation to AI/ML? In particular, I inquire which academic fields that demonstrate interaction, or rather knowledge exchange, with the field of AI/ML emerge as claiming representation of, or intervention in the social? To “capture” the interactions between the academic fields, I will rely on the concept of a network. Specifically, I will discuss how visual network analysis and scientometrics might help to understand the AI/ML in the social.
