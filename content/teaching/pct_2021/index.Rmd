### **Abstract**
The focus here is on analysing cycling potential in the open source statistical programming language R. We use R because the PCT was developed in, and can be extended with, R code. Using open source software with a command-line interface reduces barriers to entry, enabling the development of open access transport models for more citizen-led and participatory transport planning, such as integration with the A/B Street city simulation and editing software (Lovelace 2021). To view a video of our previous advanced training workshop at the Cycle Active City 2021 Conference, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiLzjrBMQmU.
