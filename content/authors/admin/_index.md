I am an ESRC-funded PGT student at CIM, University of Warwick. In 2023 I expect to start a PhD focusing on the intersection of AI controversies, expertise, and research communities.

Previously I worked as data scientist at LIDA, University of Leeds. There I was involved in two projects, one of which -- [OpenInfra project](https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra) -- was shortlisted for Leeds Digital Festival Sustainability Awards 2022.
