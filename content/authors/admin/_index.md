I am a data scientist at Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. Currently I work on a project aiming to better understand and quantify uncertainty in agent-based models. I am also involved in the [OpenInfra project](https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra) exploring the potential uses of OpenStreetMap data for transport research.
