title: "Kontracepcija kaip intervencija [Contraception as intervention]"
abstract: In this article, I discussed the importance of free access to contraception in Lithuania. I argued that it would help women experiencing intimate partner violence, especially during Covid-19 pandemic when contraception might be perceived as unnecessary spending. I also noted that free access to contraception would help teen girls and young women to control their reproduction. This, consequently, would help to plan their future knowing that, for example, teen pregnancy is related to the lower socio-economic status in the future.
