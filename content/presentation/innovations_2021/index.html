<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>A new project led by the University of Leedsâ€™ called openinfra is aiming to transform the evidence-base about infrastructure provision as it relates to walking and cycling. With input from the Department for Transport, Ordnance Survey and West Yorkshire Combined Authority, openinfra will explore the potential for open datasets, assess their strengths and weaknesses and teach best practices in using them. <a href="https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra" class="uri">https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra</a></p>
